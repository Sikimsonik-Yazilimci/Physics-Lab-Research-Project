Modeling the Electromagnetic Response of an Electric Guitar Pickup

    This repository contains the Python code and analysis for the physics lab research project, "Modeling the Electromagnetic Response of an Electric Guitar Pickup using Fourier Transforms." The project investigates the physical principles behind the signals induced by guitar pickups and models them mathematically.


Project Overview

    This project explores the relationship between a vibrating guitar string and the electrical signal it induces in a pickup. Using experimental data from a Fender Stratocaster, this analysis leverages Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to decompose the signal into its harmonic components.

The research is divided into two main experiments:

    Voltage vs. Harmonic Index: Investigating how the voltage of successive harmonics changes with the harmonic number and fitting this relationship to a theoretical model.
    Fourier Amplitude Ratios: Comparing experimentally derived Fourier amplitude ratios to theoretical predictions to test the model's accuracy under different conditions.
